# Overview

I decided to learn about sql initialization through Python. I at first thought i could call to a local database through MYSQL workbench but this
proved to be too much for the constraints of what I needed and wanted to learn about the SQLITE 3 module.

# Relational Database

I am using a simple sql database created locally the key is the designated number placement within the table which was built to resemble a deck

I created a simple 3 criteria table to organize my yugioh cards

# Development Environment

I primarily utilized VScode for its extension and flexibility.
I also used MYSQL workbench to understand the macro implications of what I was doing within the simple table I made.
